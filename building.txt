readme.txt for compiling and building 5ud0ku

During dev, 5ud0ku is mainly build using eclipse 3.1 and eclipseME plugin.
Additionally nokiaapi.jar is added from the J2ME Polish.
5ud0ku is build with settings for MIDP2-0 and CLDC1.1 from J2ME properties internally.

For external build, the build is based on (altered!) generated antenna build files from EclipseME.
This was neccessary to include the nokiaapi (corrected path setting in wtkobuscate, added classpath in wtkpreverify).

The external build is done using MIDP2.0 and CLDC1.0 
The jad and manifest will still state MIDP1.0 as the program will determine during runtime how to behave.
